# Useful References and Library QC Checks

References for sequencing read alignments and feature counting:
* "All_VSG_tile_DNA_oligo_first100bp.fasta" Fasta of the unique first 100 nts of every phage insert sequence
* "All_VSG_tile_first100bp_htseq.gff" GFF3 formatted reference for feature counting

Resources for Tile Sequence Comparisons
* "All_tiled_VSG.fasta" Fasta of protein sequences for all ~12,000 VSGs
* "edgelist_final.csv" List of all library tiles that contain shared protein sequence homology as determined by pairwise short-query blastp of 15aa tile segments

Library QC
* Histogram and summary show the number and distribution of detected phages
* Sequencing QC checks for all serum samples
