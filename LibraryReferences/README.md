# Useful References and Library QC Checks

References for sequencing read alignments and feature counting:
* "All_VSG_tile_DNA_oligo_first100bp.fasta" Fasta of the unique first 100 nts of every phage insert sequence
* "All_VSG_tile_first100bp_htseq.gff" GFF3 formatted reference for feature counting

Protein sequences for all ~12,000 VSGs contained in "All_tiled_VSG.fasta

Library QC
* Histogram and summary show the number and distribution of detected phages
* Sequencing QC checks for all serum samples
